    <center><p1>The Kawasaki Ninja H2 is a supercharged four-stroke supersport-class motorcycle in the Ninja sports bike series manufactured by Kawasaki, featuring a variable-speed centrifugal supercharger.

        Its namesake is the 750 cc Kawasaki H2 Mach IV, an inline triple that was introduced by Kawasaki in 1972 to "disrupt what it saw as a sleeping motorcycle market"
        
        Its Ninja H2R track-only variant is the fastest and most powerful production motorcycle on the market, producing a maximum of 310 horsepower (230 kW) and 326 horsepower (243 kW) with ram-air. The H2R has 50% more power than the fastest street-legal motorcycles,[which?] while the street-legal Ninja H2 has a lower power output of 200 hp (150 kW)[21]â€“210 hp (160 kW) with ram-air.[1</p1></center>

    <center><p2>According to details Kawasaki made public about the H2's engine at Intermot, it was confirmed to be a 998 cc inline-four engine with a supercharger, producing 300 horsepower (220 kW) in the track-only H2R variant, still by far the highest rated engine ever for any factory production motorcycle[32][30][31] (50% more than its nearest competitor, the BMW S1000RR).[18]Supercharged (two-speed centrifugal) 998 cc DOHC 4-valve inline-4 four-stroke</p2></center>

    <center><p3>Top speed of 183 mph (295 km/h).[10] Kent Kunitsugu, editor for Sport Rider magazine, competing in a land-speed racing event in Mojave, California at the Mojave Air and Space Port airfield in the Mojave Magnum land-speed racing, took a Ninja H2 with just a few bolt-on performance parts adding over 70 horsepower and achieved a top speed of 226.9 mph (365.2 km/h).[52][53]322 km/h (200 mph) (H2R)400 km/h (249 mph) (H2R)Cycle World recorded a 1/4-mile time of 9.62 sec. @ 152.01 mph (244.64 km/h) with a 0 to 60 mph acceleration at 2.6 seconds</p3></center>

    <center><p4>Front: 2 x 330 mm Brembo disc with radial-mount monoblock calipers Rear: 250 mm Brembo disc with radial-mount caliperMost brakes commonly use friction between two surfaces pressed together to convert the kinetic energy of the moving object into heat, though other methods of energy conversion may be employed. For example, regenerative braking converts much of the energy to electrical energy, which may be stored for later use. Other methods convert kinetic energy into potential energy in such stored forms as pressurized air or pressurized oil. Eddy current brakes use magnetic fields to convert kinetic energy into electric current in the brake disc, fin, or rail, which is converted into heat. Still other braking methods even transform kinetic energy into different forms, for example by transferring the energy to a rotating flywheel.</p4></center>
